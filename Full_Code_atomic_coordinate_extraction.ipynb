        "# Data Cleaning Procedure:\n",
        "\n",
        "We are working with a dataset containing protein names from the PDB site, and our goal is to streamline the data cleaning process using automated methods. While manual downloading is possible on the site, we aim to create a code that can handle this task efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the step-by-step process we'll follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Retrieval and Initial Filtering:**\n",
        "   We will initiate the process by extracting protein names from the PDB site. Our code will then automatically download the corresponding files. This approach simplifies data scraping and enhances efficiency, providing a structured dataset. While direct manual downloads are feasible, automation offers more streamlined handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Categorization of Protein Types:**\n",
        "   After the initial download, we will categorize the proteins based on their types. Proteins that are DNAs (NMR) and EM (complexes) will be identified and segregated into a separate CSV file. This segregation ensures that the dataset remains organized and suitable for downstream analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Refining the Dataset:**\n",
        "   We will proceed by eliminating undesired data points. This involves removing proteins with low resolutions and excluding those that are not based on X-ray experiment types. This refinement step ensures that the dataset consists of high-quality, relevant protein structures for further processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Handling Multi-Chain Files:**\n",
        "   For proteins composed of multiple chains, such as the example 1abc with 2 chains, we will create distinct entries for each chain. This separation results in entries like 1abc_1 and 1abc_2. By doing this, we maintain granularity in our dataset, enabling more precise analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By following this refined data cleaning procedure, we aim to establish a well-structured and comprehensive dataset that can be effectively utilized for various analyses and modeling tasks."
